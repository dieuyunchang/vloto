Ok, I will need some changes 
rename even-odd-summary.json to date-even-odd-summary-all.json
in the "Number Frequency Summary", rename to "Number Frequency Summary (All)"
Add the tab with 
tab 1: Number Frequency Summary, keep current Number Frequency Summary
tab 2: Month Summary, get from month-summary.json, list the 12 months with each month will list the percentage of each number 
tab 3: Day of Week Summary, get from day-of-week-summary.json, list the 7 days with each day will list the percentage of each number
tab 4: Day of Month Summary, get from day-of-month-summary.json, list the 31 days with each day will list the percentage of each number
tab 5: Date Even/Odd Summary, get from even-odd-summary.json, list the date even and odd with the percentage of each number
